# Space Simulator
A space simulator test in Godot. Basically Kerbal Space Program but more tech showcase than game. Will make until get bored.

## How it works
I will explain when it will work.

## Things done and to do
- [ ] Astronomical objects (generated via shaders)
  - [ ] Graphics
    - [x] Basic colors and texture parameters
    - [ ] Atmosphere (clouds)
    - [ ] Different terrain types
    - [ ] Different planet types (gas, rocky, sand)
  - [ ] Objects
    - [x] Star
    - [x] Planet
    - [ ] Moon for planet
    - [ ] Second planet
- [ ] Correct astronomical distances
- [ ] Spaceship
  - [ ] Interior
    - [ ] Model
    - [ ] Textures
  - [ ] Onboard instruments
    - [ ] Speedometer
    - [ ] Navball
    - [ ] Attitude meter
- [ ] Controls
  - [ ] Camera
  - [ ] Spaceship controls
- [ ] Physics
  - [ ] Position updates
  - [ ] Gravity
  - [ ] Correct planet rotations
  - [ ] Correct planet orbits
  - [ ] Destroy spaceship in atmosphere (temporary solution until surface will be implemented)
- [ ] Navigation
  - [ ] Some "map view"
  - [ ] Navball indicators for maneuvers
### Further goals
- [ ] Planet surfaces
- [ ] Atmospheric physics (burning in atmoshpere, flying)
- [ ] Landing
- [ ] Space station
- [ ] Docking
